# CodeClause-Calculator-Project
In this code, I have created a calculator in Python.
I have added functions for additional operations such as calculating the square root, exponentials and calculating logarithms. 
The display_menu() function prints the available options.
The calculator() function contains the main loop where the user can enter their choice and perform the desired operation. 
The program continues until the user chooses to exit by entering '8'.
